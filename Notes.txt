notes:

make language/program data agnostic/flexible

do not want to adjust python on the fly

should call from database for keywords, etc.

focus on tracking one level of task, then adding in layers afterwards

seed some garbage data with intentional tracking tags to simulate

database idea:
tagging for start and end of conversation in database?
tagging conversation ex: task 1, task 2
tagging sub conversations ex: sub task 1, sub task 2

use python to call chat logs from database, create conversation/topic objects, 
insert those into a separate table in the database for graphing a GANTT chart

Name - Start - End (required for GANTT chart)

displaying concurrent messages with the conversation?

Ex: |---------------Conversation name------------|
     •chat 1  •chat 2

is this doable with grafana GANTT plugin?
IS doable with Data Links Link data as time range based on currently selected 
portion of GANTT graph, showing nearby timed messages in a separate field
