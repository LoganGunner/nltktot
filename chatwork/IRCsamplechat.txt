[19:28:36] <Neito> I believe I said those exact words a couple years ago, the first time.
[19:28:38] <Apusp> Yo
[19:29:20] <Neito> Still, it's not the Tribes situation, where giving in the the people begging for something is going to ruin what you're doing.
[19:29:21] <wip> Torchlight2 tonight?/
[19:29:32] <Apreche> yes, Torchlight 2 tonight
[19:29:39] <Apreche> will get home 5:30ish
[19:29:44] <Apreche> hmmm
[19:29:53] <Apreche> just realized I did not do anything in order to maintain Op in this channel when I leave work.
[19:30:00] <Apusp> What point in game are ya Apreche?
[19:30:10] <Apreche> I am early on in second town.

[19:31:06] <Neito> Some clients alias /cs to /msg chanserv.
[19:31:38] <Apreche> that didn't do anything
[19:32:01] <wip> man, irssi is awesome with Terminator
[19:32:05] <Neito> It should tell you how to register a channel and set yourself up as founder, so you can get/regain ops when need be.
[19:32:46] <pence> man, I always feel dirty registering passwords in plaintext with nickserv
[19:32:53] <Neito> So, I don't know if this is a rumor or fact at this point, but it appears EA released FIFA 2012 on the Wii as if it were FIFA 2013.
[19:33:25] <Neito> And just changed the title screen.
[19:33:40] <wip> meh
[19:34:56] <Neito> Granted, this is Reddit linking to a blog called Nintendo Gamer that I've never heard of prior to this story, but they got pictchas.
[19:35:07] <Apreche> that did not give me any useful instructions
[19:35:43] <wip> http://wiki.foonetic.net
[19:36:17] <Neito> Wow. OK, so, the chanserv built in help doesn't tell you how to register. Lovely.
[19:36:37] <pence> /msg chanserv help register
[19:37:45] <Apusp> Have I told people enought how I love finally having a computer that runs games better than 15fps?
[19:38:17] <Apreche> says I have to login to register
[19:38:31] <Neito> I love having a comptuer that has a hard drive, right now.
[19:38:36] <Apreche> how to login?

[19:52:12] <Neito> Steam's starting the beta for the Linux version next month.
[19:52:19] <Apusp> O.O
[19:52:22] <Apreche> I thought only 1000 people are getting in
[19:52:22] <wip> Much excite
[19:52:30] <Neito> Yeah.
[19:52:34] <Neito> Still, starting is a good sign.
[19:52:38] <Apreche> and it is not going to be a pleasurable user experience, for experts only
[19:52:50] <Apreche> guess it can't be worse than hlds for Linux! *sickburn*
[19:53:21] <Neito> To be fair, they did remove the feature where it emails all your friends calling you a faggot. Which was nice.
[19:53:33] <ninjarabbi> still easier than wine, anyway
[19:54:56] <Neito> http://rss.slashdot.org
[19:55:15] <wip> lol ./
[19:55:39] <wip> rather /.
[19:55:56] <Neito> I only really follow Slashdot and two Fark tabs anymore.
[19:55:59] <Apreche> I heard /. just got sold to new owners
[19:56:05] <Neito> Yeah.
[19:56:08] <Neito> I already forgot who.
[19:56:12] <wip> lol fark
[19:56:28] <Neito> Oh, right.
[19:56:29] <Neito> Dice.
[19:56:33] <Apreche> lol
[19:56:51] <Apreche> when I bike to work there is this parked car with Dice ads all over it.
[19:57:02] <Neito> Do people actually get jobs off of Dice? I know a lot of people look there, but I've never actually heard of anyone getting a job of note from there.
[19:57:21] <Apreche> you can get a job on Dice if you have really boring corporate tech skills
[19:57:38] <Apreche> like you want to do JBoss for some ISO9000 place
[19:57:38] <Neito> So, you can be the "Exchange guy" for the rest of your life. Thrilling.
[19:59:20] <Apreche> what is the command to list who is in the channel?
[20:00:58] <Neito> Depends on your client. I'm using XChat, so I just have a user list off to the right of the channel.
[20:01:38] <ninjarabbi> yeah I just use mibbit and I have the same thing
[20:01:40] <Apreche> I thought that is something the server does
[20:02:05] <Neito> You can also do /who #geeknights.
[20:02:17] <Neito> No, userlist is client-side.
[20:02:20] <Apreche> yeah, but that shows up in the command window
[20:02:50] <Apreche> ok, in IRSSI it is /names
[20:03:38] <Apusp> so it seems. Didn't know that. For some reason never care too much who's on channels with me.
[20:03:38] Apreche changed topic of #geeknights to: GeekNights Podcast - frontrowcrew.com
[20:04:25] <Neito> ... Wow, apparently there are actually people who want the WiiU.
[20:04:42] <Apreche> who is that?
[20:04:51] <Neito> Enough that GameStop is cutting off pre-orders.
[20:05:14] <Neito> It's probably the same "Buy a console and one party game" demographic that carried the Wii.
[20:05:31] <Apreche> it will sell maybe slightly more than the 3DS at best, due to holiday season.
[20:05:42] <Apreche> you gotta buy the kid something, and what else is there?
[20:05:46] <Neito> True.
[20:05:53] <Neito> (Answer: Books)
[20:05:59] <pence> it's got the name nintendo on it, someone will want it
[20:06:13] <ninjarabbi> I want one, but short of a miracle theres no way I'm getting a launch wiiU
[20:06:14] <Neito> Honestly, I don't regret buying my 3DS.
[20:06:34] <pence> at least, that's more true now than when the virtual boy was released
[20:06:54] <ninjarabbi> I got a wii at launch and don't regret it one bit but the WiiU just doesn't have that same pull
[20:06:55] <Neito> But my DS was also half-broken. It was either "Buy a DS Lite now and a 3DS in a couple years when they have their amazing games" or "Buy a 3DS now and don't waste money on a Lite".
[20:07:12] <Apreche> I may get one one day... There are a few good games for it, but I haen't finished regular DS games
[20:07:23] <Apreche> haven't beaten Edgeworth Investigations.
[20:07:27] <Neito> Keep your DS. Flashkarts rarely work on the 3DS.
[20:07:39] <Apreche> I didn't even know the 3DS had flash carts at al
[20:07:44] <Neito> It doesn't.
[20:07:59] <Neito> But sometimes you can get a DS flashcart to work in DS mode on a 3DS.
[20:08:14] <ninjarabbi> Just get a used Lite on craigslist or something for dirt cheap just to use with flash carts.
[20:09:17] <Neito> So far the only hint of flashcart working would only be useful for bootlegging, not pirating.
[20:09:29] <Neito> Same with the Vita.
[20:09:32] <Apusp> That was a dissapointing round of Arms Race.
[20:09:53] <pence> I'll get a 3ds as soon as I can buy that Layton/Phoenix Wright crossover game
[20:09:57] <Apusp> So will there be forum CS:Go server, I want to get to shoot forumites?
[20:10:49] <Apreche> when Rym returns from India
[20:10:55] <Apreche> which is Saturday
[20:11:40] <ninjarabbi> I still want a 1.6 server. For some reason I only find shitty servers with CS1.6 nowadays
[20:12:43] <Apusp> I would think that the kind of people who still play 1.6 have their own little inside servers of elitism. But what do I know abdout 1.6.
[20:13:18] <Apreche> purists
[20:13:22] <ninjarabbi> thats what I was hoping but most of the ones I tried were pretty sheisty. At least last time I tried
[20:26:10] <Apreche> I think a lot of the lasting popularity of 1.6 on pubs is crazy mods people play
[20:26:15] <Apreche> and the crazy mods aren't on CS:S or CS:GO
[20:26:24] <wip> That, or they are just insane
[20:26:30] <wip> I think it's mostly the later
[20:26:57] <Apreche> I want to see a CS:GO/NS2 crossover.
[20:27:07] <Apreche> marines planting bombs
[20:27:10] <Apreche> terrorists growing hives
[20:28:28] <ninjarabbi> is NS2 not crashy yet?
[20:28:39] <Apreche> It hasn't been crashy in many months
[20:28:46] <Apusp> I don't need why there wouldn't be crazy mods on CS:S?
[20:29:03] <Apusp> Tried to try NS2 today, serverlist full of empty.
[20:29:06] <Neito> By the way, Scott. YOu were asking what's different in Steam half-minute hero vs. XBox.
[20:29:14] <Neito> I can confirm there's online multiplater in this version.
[20:29:37] <Apusp> What kind?
[20:29:57] <Neito> I dunno.
[20:30:04] <Neito> I just know there's online multiplayer.
[20:30:41] <wip> I haven't played NS2 in a while
[20:30:47] <wip> since before exo
[20:31:56] <Apusp> Simpliest multiplayer I can imagine in Half minute hero would be racing against each other in real time, but that would be same as racing agasint your friends ghost, except you could trashtalk over skype.
[20:36:46] <Neito> It is a race.
[20:37:01] <Apreche> it would be cool if it was somehow vs.
[20:37:08] <Neito> With the catch that if one person prays at the time godess statue, time resets for both players.
[20:37:09] <Apreche> you come out of one castle, the other guy come sout of the other one
[20:37:27] <Neito> So there's a bit of bluffing/playing chicken with the other guy.
[20:37:31] <Apreche> oh, so its easier because you get a few free statues the other guy paid for.
[20:37:48] <Neito> Or harder because he refuses to pay and you have to pay for all of them.
[20:37:56] <Apreche> no
[20:38:00] <Apreche> in that case you just let everyone die
[20:38:13] <Apreche> happens in board games all the time
[20:38:24] <Apreche> Rym will win if you don't do X, I absolutely refuse to do it
[20:38:28] <Apreche> thereby forcing other player to do it
[20:38:39] <Apreche> never be the guy who does it
[20:38:44] <Apreche> armageddon is better than losing.
[20:40:16] <Apreche> What's teh best IRC for iOS?
[20:41:00] <Apreche> oh, Colloquy is good, but they are charging $2

[20:52:22] <farragar> Not surprising, sometimes I feel like it's time for a change. One of those middleschool names
[20:52:33] <Apreche> my name is an early high school name
[20:52:36] <farragar> At least, I think it's middleschool. Is middleschool when you're like 15 or some shit?
[20:52:53] <wip> 12ish?
[20:53:41] <farragar> Right, well I think I was about 15

[20:57:01] <Neito> My nicks how you spell Nate in Katakana.
[20:57:09] <Neito> (I was bored one day, years ago)
[20:57:32] <Apreche> Wouldn't that be Naito?
[20:57:51] <Neito> Not according to my Japanese teacher.
[20:57:55] <Apreche> ok then
[20:57:58] <Neito> I always assumed I srewed it up.
[20:58:01] <Apreche> shows what I know

[22:38:18] <Bronzdragon> Which both?
[22:38:29] <Aria> I like the concept of there being a new #geeknights!
[22:38:34] <Bronzdragon> Hey, are you Apsup?
[22:38:48] <Bronzdragon> Because I can't tell due to possible misspellings.
[22:38:52] Apusp is now known as Apsup
[22:38:56] <Aria> Are you accusing the gentleman of misspelling his own name?!
[22:38:57] <Bronzdragon> =P
[22:38:59] <pence> hahaha
[22:39:06] <Apsup> New keyboard, I blme it.
[22:39:10] <Apsup> *blame
[22:39:13] <Apsup> fuck this thing.
[22:39:18] <pence> /slowclap
[22:39:19] <Bronzdragon> Eh, it's not so bad
[22:39:26] <Aria> You should give it to me, I need a new keyboard
[22:39:31] <Aria> does it have fancy assignable keys?
[22:39:36] <Bronzdragon> I used to hate this keyboard too, being completely unable to press spacebar with any consistency.
[22:39:43] <Apsup> This is cheap 20e crap one.
[22:39:45] <Bronzdragon> Look at me know, spacing out all over the place!
[22:39:53] <Aria> He also presses enter every time he tries to press backspace
[22:39:59] <Bronzdragon> ...
[22:40:24] <Aria> (I also can't hit the backspace on his keyboard)
[22:40:31] <Apsup> This doesn't even have basic media keys, something I miss from my laptop.
[22:40:35] <pence> as long as it doesn't have an L-shaped enter key or a vertical arrangement above the arrow keys... or weirdly shaped keys...
[22:40:37] <Bronzdragon> My backspace is smaller then my menu key
[22:40:59] <Bronzdragon> What's wrong with L-shaped enter?
[22:41:35] <pence> I always feel weird pressing an L-shaped enter with my pinky
[22:41:40] <pence> like, "why is this so large"
[22:41:53] <Bronzdragon> ... you aren't supposed to look at your keyboard.
[22:41:56] <Bronzdragon> =P
[22:42:27] <pence> this is just one of my lines in the sand!
[22:42:27] <Bronzdragon> I also like to finish my sentences while chatting with a flourish
[22:42:39] <Bronzdragon> Where I lift my hand, and hit it with my middle finger.
[22:43:22] <Bronzdragon> What I hate is that my backspace key is tiny
[22:43:27] <Bronzdragon> I think it's no good
[22:43:38] <Bronzdragon> Also, my sleep key should not be so damn close to my escape key!
[22:43:45] <Bronzdragon> Goddamn, the times I've hit that by accident...
[22:44:04] <Aria> It also seems to be the most sensetive key
[22:44:08] <Aria> going off when you shake his keyboard
[22:44:09] <Bronzdragon> It's like the escape key is on an island all by itself, but then the sleep key intrudes for no reason
[22:44:21] <Bronzdragon> Stupid pushy sleep key!
[22:48:47] <pence> either I fail at steam, or there's no easy way to just invite random people into a chat (this may be a feature not a bug)
[22:50:00] <Bronzdragon> Both are possible
[22:50:04] <Bronzdragon> but I think you're wrong
[22:50:17] <Bronzdragon> So, see that little green man in the top left? with a dropdown arrow?
[22:50:21] <Bronzdragon> I think it's there that you can invite people
